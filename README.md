This code has functions that can:

tell you all previous chat names of the groupchat

tell you how many messages a person has sent

tell you how many words a person has sent

tell you how many words a person sends per message on average

filter the csv to exclude empty messages and hyperlinked messages

generate a cool word cloud of the most frequent (uncommon) words used in the chat
